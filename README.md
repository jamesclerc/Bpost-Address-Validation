# Documentation Address Validation

Hi ! I'm James and i did a script that take an excel with all the address in a column and check if the address is valid of not.

## Language used

Python with requests module

## Address validation

Using the bpost api i retrieve all the address on a file then with another script i parse all the errors and warning related in each address to retrieve the result (true of false if validate or not).
